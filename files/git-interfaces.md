# Git interfaces

Git can be used via GUI or command line interfaces i.e.

* Source Tree
* eGit (Eclipse plugin)
* Git Bash
* Bash
* Windows Command Line
* Tortoise

The one we will be using, to see how things work in the background, is Git Bash. Note, hubs such as GitHub, GitLab and BitBucket provide git services plus additional layers such as project management and issue tracking, which git does not provide natively.
